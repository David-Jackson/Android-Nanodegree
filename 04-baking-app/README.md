## Project #4: Baking App
*In this project, you will create an app to view video recipes. You will handle media loading, verify your user interfaces with UI tests, and integrate third party libraries. You'll also provide a complete user experience with a home screen widget.*

### Features
- Material Design: from shared element transitions, to [animated vector drawables](https://github.com/David-Jackson/Android-Nanodegree/raw/master/04-baking-app/images/navigation_avd.gif), this app was designed from the ground up to incorporate material design principles.
- [Tablet Layouts](https://github.com/David-Jackson/Android-Nanodegree/raw/master/04-baking-app/images/device-2018-08-17-165802.png): this app also incorporates fragments and reusable layouts to provide a much better experience on bigger screens.
- Video Playback
- Homescreen Widget
